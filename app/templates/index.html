In our problem, since the numeric values for rap and classical are significantly different, the categories of each data points neighbors are most likely going to be the same category as the data point itself.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Because our problem is a classification problem, using a Decision Tree Classifier is always an option. A Decision Tree Classifier works by learning simple decision rules from the training data. There is a root in the tree, which is the first question in the tree. In the root the DTC compares the root attribute with the data point's attribute. Based on this comparison, the DTC follows the corresponding branch and eventually classifies the data point. In our problem, there may be many layers in DTC with example questions such as Is the loudness less than .3? DTC uses these questions to help classify data points.</p>

                        <h2>Logistic Regression Classifier: Explanation</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Logistic Regression is another supervised classification algorithm than we can use in this problem. The model builds a regression model to predict the probability that a given data entry belongs to the category numbered as “1”. Just like Linear regression assumes that the data follows a linear function, Logistic regression models the data using the sigmoid function. In our problem, we are using binomial logistic regression because we only have two labels, 1 or 0, rap or classical music.</p>

                        <p class="lead">In conclusion, all three models that we picked perform really well for the task of predicting the genre of a song. The best model was the Decision Tree Classifier, having perfect predictions. All of them can prove our thesis that rap is very different from classical music and that they can easily be labled based on data about thir musical features. One way we can improve our model is to play around with different subsets of feature data and see which subset gives us a higher accuracy. Another way we can imporve our model is to perfrom cross validation or grid search in order to see what parameters are best for our models. Something we can further do expand this project is to compare another genre of music. We can change our model into a multi label classifier by adding another genre to predict. Another possible advancement of this project is to conduct NLP analysis on the lyrics of songs using the Genuis API. </p>

                        <h3>So what?</h3>
                            
                        <p class="lead">So what is the significance of our project? Humans are able to tell apart different musical genres just by listening with their ears. This project has shown as that computers can do the same thing, without even needing ears or even needing to listen to the song.</p>
